			<h1>Jovian Life</h1>

				Adding quality-of-life improvements feels nice! I added a "game config"
				file with all the paths to the planet configs, and Jupiter and
				one of the four Galilean moons, Io.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also addressed a small issue,
				which made Jupiter's label look like "Jopiter" (and that's a goofy name).
				The problem was that
				the moon's label (Io) overlapped with Jupiter's when viewed from Earth.
				Fixing that was quite easy: you only need to check if the distance
				between a celestial body and its parent (relative the the
				current viewing position, so
				<code><b>distance</b>(<b>ParentPos</b>, <b>ChildPos</b>) /
					<b>distance</b>(<b>ParentPos</b>, <b>CameraPos</b>) &lt; <b>Threshold</b></code>)
			</p>
			<p>So this is the view from the Earth</p>
